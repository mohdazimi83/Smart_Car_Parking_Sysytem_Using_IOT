### 🧠 Tech Stack  
- **Hardware:** Arduino UNO, IR Sensors, 16x2 LCD, PCF8574 I2C Module  
- **Software:** Arduino IDE, Proteus 8 Professional  
- **Programming:** Embedded C / Arduino  

---

### ⚙️ Features  
✅ Automatically detects filled and empty parking slots  
✅ Real-time slot status displayed on LCD  
✅ Entry/Exit detection using IR sensors  
✅ Simulated and tested in Proteus 8 Professional  
✅ Compact, efficient, and scalable design

### 🧩 Working Principle  
1. **IR Sensors** monitor each slot and entry/exit area.  
2. When a vehicle enters, **Arduino UNO** checks for available slots.  
3. The **LCD Display** updates the status of each slot as *Fill* or *Empty*.  
4. When the vehicle exits, the slot status updates automatically to *Empty*.
